# Emai-website

Developed the frontend of an Email website using Javascript and Django and utilized API calls to exchange emails between users as part of my projects in the Edx Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# Quick start:

Register for 2 accounts using something like user1@example.com. Then log in and send emails from one account to another.
