# Email-website

Developed the frontend of an Email website using Javascript and Django and utilized API calls to exchange emails between users as part of my projects in the Edx Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

# Quick start:

Open VS code and make sure to install Django with:

	pip3 install Django 

After opening the clock-in app in VS code, make sure your terminal shows ‘your-computer’/mail/mail. You can do this by typing the following in the terminal:

	cd mail
 
Then type:

	python manage.py makemigrations
 
Then type:

	python manage.py migrate
 
Then run the server:

	Python manage.py runserver

Register for 2 accounts using something like user1@example.com. Then log in and send emails from one account to another.
